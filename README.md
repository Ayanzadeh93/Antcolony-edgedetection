# edge detection by Ant Colony

A modified ant colony based approach to digital image edge detection

The performance of proposed method is compared with traditional ant colony methods, also we have large number of experiments to find out the suitable threshold for proposed method. The experimental results clearly indicate how the ACO can extracts edges in efficient way, also we speed up the proposed method by modifying the effective parameters in speed of the problem and replacing them by optimized values. The results show that this method is faster and more efficient than other former Ant Colony-based edge detection methods.
